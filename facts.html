            <p>Tom Cruise is a mix of Irish, German, and English.</p> 
            <p>Tom was raised a devout Catholic, and even considered becoming a priest.</p>
            <p>Cruise walked away from the role of Tony Stark in Iron Man because "As it was lining up, it just didn't feel to me like it was gonna work."</p>
            <p>At age 10, he spent his savings on a motorcycle. Yea that's right, age 10. And yes, he crashed it almost immediately.</p>
            <p>Tom will not allow any video game or action figure likenesses of himself to be made. He even demanded that his character in the Minority Report game be changed to another figure, which is why the character has blond hair.</p>
            <p>Cruise left his school's wrestling team after a knee injury.</p>
